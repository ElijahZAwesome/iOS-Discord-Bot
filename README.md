# iOS-Discord-Bot
A simple bot that can be ran from an iPhone
# About
Be careful, this will use up a lot of power and drain your battery.
# Installation
Open the project in Xcode. 

if you want to, you can also open TextEdit and make a file called `token.txt` containing your bot token. then right click the SwordBot folder in Xcode and click `Add files`, and add that token file. This will put in your token on boot.

You can also put in your token in the app itself.

Then connect your device of choice and press play. You may have to install it a few times because it decides not to work.

# Credit
Credit for Sword goes to Azoy#2018, I made everything but that, and this wouldn't be possible without his work.

If you use this for anything, credit is nice but its up to you. Otherwise feel free to do whatever
